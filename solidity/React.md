The main difference between useState and useEffect in React lies in their purpose and functionality:

# Purpose:
+ useState: Used to create and manage state within a functional component. It stores values that can change over time, and when you update these values, React re-renders the component to reflect the new state.
+ useEffect: Used to manage side effects in a component, which are operations that don’t directly impact the rendered output but might involve asynchronous work, external interactions, or clean-up actions. Examples include fetching data, setting up subscriptions, updating the DOM, or managing timers.

# Usage:
+ useState: Defines a state variable and a function to update it.
```
const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
```
`#000000`
`#ffffff`
+ useEffect: Runs a function when the component mounts, updates, or unmounts. You can specify dependencies to control when the effect should re-run.
```
useEffect(() => {
  // Code that runs after the component mounts or updates.

  return () => {
    // Optional cleanup code for when the component unmounts or dependencies change.
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

# Behavior:
+ useState: Triggers a re-render of the component each time the state changes. This makes it ideal for dynamic data that should immediately reflect in the UI, like user input.
+ useEffect: Does not cause a re-render on its own. It’s used to run code after React has already updated the DOM, so you can perform actions in response to state or prop changes without initiating another render loop.

# Examples of When to Use:
+ useState: For tracking UI changes or data updates within the component, such as a counter, form input, or selection status.
+ useEffect: For side effects, like fetching data from an API, setting up event listeners, or manually manipulating the DOM.

# Example Comparison:
Here's a component that uses both useState and useEffect:
```
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function ExampleComponent() {
  // useState to manage a counter state.
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // useEffect to log a message to the console whenever count changes.
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(`Count updated to: ${count}.`);

    return () => {
      console.log('Cleaning up after count changed.');
    };
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example:
+ useState handles the count state, which changes when the button is clicked.
+ useEffect logs to the console whenever count updates and cleans up by logging a message just before the next effect.
