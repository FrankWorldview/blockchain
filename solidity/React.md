`useState` and `useEffect` are two of the most commonly used hooks in React, enabling you to add state and manage side effects in functional components. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown of each:

# useState
+ Purpose: useState allows you to create and manage state within functional components.
+ Usage: You use useState to store data that may change over time and needs to trigger re-renders when updated. Examples include form inputs, toggles, counters, or any dynamic content.

Syntax:
```
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```
+ state: The current state value.
+ setState: A function to update the state value.

Example:
```
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

In this example, count is the state variable managed by useState, and setCount updates it. Every time setCount is called, React re-renders the component with the updated count.

# useEffect
+ Purpose: useEffect is used to handle side effects in functional components, which are tasks that need to happen outside of rendering (such as data fetching, subscriptions, timers, or DOM manipulations).
+ Usage: useEffect takes a function that runs after each render. You can control when the effect runs by providing dependencies in an array as the second argument.
  - No dependencies ([]): Runs only once on component mount.
  - With dependencies: Runs whenever specified dependencies change.
  - No array: Runs on every render.

Syntax:
```
useEffect(() => {
  // Your code here (e.g., data fetching, setting up subscriptions).

  return () => {
    // Optional cleanup code (e.g., unsubscribing, clearing timers).
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

Example 1:
```
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function FetchDataOnMount() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Fetching data on component mount...");
    fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));

    // No dependencies: this effect runs only once when the component mounts.
  }, []); 

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Data: {data ? JSON.stringify(data) : "Loading..."}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default FetchDataOnMount;
```

In this example, useEffect fetches data from an API only once when the component mounts because the dependency array is empty ([]).

Example 2:
```
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function UpdateMessageOnCountChange() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("Initial message");

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(`Count changed to ${count}`);
    setMessage(`Count is now ${count}`);
  }, [count]); // Effect depends on `count`.

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{message}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase Count</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UpdateMessageOnCountChange;
```

# Key Differences Between useState and useEffect
+ Purpose: useState is for managing local state, while useEffect is for handling side effects.
+ Rerenders: useState triggers a re-render when the state changes, whereas useEffect does not cause re-renders by itself but runs after each render if dependencies have changed.
+ Together, useState and useEffect enable powerful, flexible control over data and actions in functional components, making them fundamental for managing state and lifecycle effects in React.
