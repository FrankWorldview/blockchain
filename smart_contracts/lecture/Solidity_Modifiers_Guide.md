# Solidity Modifiers: A Complete Overview

## Introduction

Modifiers in Solidity are keywords that define the behavior of functions and variables. They help manage **visibility**, **mutability**, **inheritance**, and **access control**. This document outlines major types of modifiers and provides comparison tables for easy reference.

## 1. Visibility Modifiers

Visibility modifiers control **where** functions and state variables can be accessed.

| Modifier     | Applies To            | Description                                                  |
|--------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `public`     | Functions, Variables   | Accessible externally and internally. Creates a getter for variables. |
| `external`   | Functions              | Callable only from outside the contract. Slightly more gas efficient. |
| `internal`   | Functions, Variables   | Accessible only from this contract and its derived contracts. |
| `private`    | Functions, Variables   | Accessible only from this contract.                          |

## 2. Mutability Modifiers

Mutability modifiers indicate **how** functions interact with the blockchain state.

| Modifier     | Applies To | Description                                                         |
|--------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `view`       | Functions  | Promises not to modify state. Can read state variables.             |
| `pure`       | Functions  | Promises not to read or modify state. Used for pure computation.    |
| `payable`    | Functions  | Allows the function to receive Ether. Required for receiving ETH.   |
| (none)       | Functions  | Function may modify state and interact with Ether transfer.         |

## 3. Inheritance Modifiers

These are used when writing **inheritable contracts and methods**.

| Modifier     | Applies To | Description                                                            |
|--------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `virtual`    | Functions  | Allows a function to be overridden by child contracts.                 |
| `override`   | Functions  | Used in derived contracts to override a base contract's function.      |
| `abstract`   | Contracts  | A contract that contains at least one unimplemented function.          |

## 4. Access Control Modifiers (Custom)

Custom modifiers are often used to restrict **who** can execute a function.

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the contract owner");
    _;
}
```

You can then use it like:

```solidity
function withdraw() public onlyOwner {
    // withdraw logic
}
```

## Summary Table

| Category              | Modifiers                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Visibility**        | `public`, `external`, `internal`, `private`    |
| **Mutability**        | `view`, `pure`, `payable`                      |
| **Inheritance**       | `virtual`, `override`, `abstract`              |
| **Access Control**    | `custom` modifiers (e.g., `onlyOwner`, `onlyAdmin`) |

## Conclusion

Modifiers in Solidity allow developers to enforce constraints, define access levels, and optimize contract structure. Understanding and applying them appropriately is key to writing secure and efficient smart contracts.
